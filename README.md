simple little java program to download wynncrafts server resource pack because wynn decided to block all download requests that dont have the minecraft user-agent header

this thing can also extract the files from it using code i yoinked from mcrpx so thanks for that i guess

download is in the releases tab (https://github.com/quartzexpressDEV/WynncraftResourceDownloader/releases)
